# Chat_App
This is a chat app designed for simultaneous communication between two users. Forking has been done to create two processes inside both client and server code , one for receiving and one for sending data. The addresses needs to be adjusted based on the IP addresses of the two communicating components.
The code is based on Berkeley Sockets hence , it can only be run on Linux based Systems.
